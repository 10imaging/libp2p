# libp2p Roadmap

> We track the development of the libp2p project through Github issues and [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/libp2p/libp2p). See our waffle board at: [https://waffle.io/libp2p/libp2p](https://waffle.io/libp2p/libp2p)

For higher level planning, we use [OKRs](https://github.com/libp2p/pm/tree/master/OKRs).

For feature completeness, we are tracking in [REQUIREMENTS.md](https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p/blob/master/REQUIREMENTS.md).
